I am most passionate about research questions that can inform marine policy and management decisions when facing mounting environmental changes. My approach to research combines a mix of data science in R, GIS & spatial modeling, field observational studies, and laboratory analyses and incorporates both interdisciplinary collaboration and the mentoring of undergraduate trainees. Although much of my research takes place in benthic systems in NorthWest Atlantic and seagrass beds in the Gulf of Mexico, I prefer to answer questions that are broadly applicable to other systems and regions.\r\nResearch Themes\r\nBiogeography & Macroecology\r\nEcosystem Functions & Services\r\nClimate Change\r\nMarine Conservation Science\r\nSpatial Planning\r\nEducation:\r\nPhD Candidate, Geography, Department of Geography, Florida State University (2017-Present)\r\nDual M.Sc., Marine Biology & Marine Policy, School of Marine Science, University of Maine (2014)\r\nB.Sc., Marine Science, School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine (2010)\r\nContact Information:\r\nJennifer McHenry\r\n113 Collegiate Loop\r\nBellamy Building, Room 307\r\nPO Box 3062190\r\nTallahassee FL 32306-2190\r\njamchenry@fsu.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
